The backend was built with javascript, node.js, express, mongodb atlas,   
bcryptjs to encrypt and decrypt the users' password, colors to make certain console logs pop out, 
cors tells the browser that the app at its origin has access to resources at another origin, 
dotenv to keep certain information secret, express-async-handler to handle async express route exceptions, 
jsonwebtoken to give each user a unique token, and ts-node with typescript.

The frontend utilizes Angular Material with TailwindCss for styling, Google fonts and material icons, leaflet for the map, ngx-toastr for the messages, and paypal to handle payment.
